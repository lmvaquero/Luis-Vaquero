#### Rule Hypervolume Overlaps to Remove Redundance in Rule-based Systems
Takes rules from any system (IP tables, routing policies, IDS rules, etc.) to detect duplicated rules and reduce load on the rule engine. The system creates a hyperspace for the rules and detected hypevolume overlaps building on a modified Jaccard similarity algo.
