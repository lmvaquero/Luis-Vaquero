## Luis Vaquero (about me) - "This world is but a canvas to our imagination" Henry David Thoreau

Curiosity is the word that probably best describes my character. I have worked on social constructivism theories and their relation to computers, performed experiments on animals to measure the electrical activity of excitable cells, deployed large cloud computing environments for big telcos, and large-scale analytic systems for large IT corporations. 

I am also a very pragmatic person. My work is aimed at delivering high returns on investment: driven by customer obsesion as a practicioner and love for challenging conventional wisdom as an academic 

I have always been fascinated by the way our brains work (neurologically and socially). Reading about Gaia in Asimov's "Foundation's Edge" as a kid sparkled this constant chase to understand more about learning in human and computer brains. I guess this quest for understanding the human mind has made me a much better people manager.

#### Rule Hypervolume Overlaps to Remove Redundance in Rule-based Systems
Takes rules from any system (IP tables, routing policies, IDS rules, etc.) to detect duplicated rules and reduce load on the rule engine. The system creates a hyperspace for the rules and detected hypevolume overlaps building on a modified Jaccard similarity algo.
