## Luis Vaquero (about me) - "This world is but a canvas to our imagination" Henry David Thoreau

Curiosity is the word that probably best describes my character. I have worked on social constructivism theories and their relation to computers, performed experiments on animals to measure the electrical activity of excitable cells, deployed large cloud computing environments for big telcos, and large-scale analytic systems for large IT corporations.

I am also a very pragmatic person. My work is aimed at delivering high returns on investment: driven by customer obsesion as a practicioner and love for challenging conventional wisdom as an academic

I have always been fascinated by the way our brains work (neurologically and socially). Reading about Gaia in Asimov's "Foundation's Edge" as a kid sparkled this constant chase to understand more about learning in human and computer brains. I guess this quest for understanding the human mind has made me a much better people manager.
